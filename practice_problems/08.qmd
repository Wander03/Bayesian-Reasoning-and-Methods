Assume the amount of sleep (hours) that a randomly selected Cal Poly student gets on a typical week night follows a Normal distribution with mean theta hours and standard deviation 1.5 hours. 

Assume that the prior distribution of theta is Normal with mean 8 and standard deviation 0.5.

In a sample of 25 Cal Poly students, the sample mean amount of sleep is 7.1 hours.

You perform a Bayesian analysis of the data, and your posterior distribution is approximately Normal with posterior mean 7.34 and posterior standard deviation 0.26.

Note: you can use software to compute. However, you might want to compute by hand for practice (especially if youâ€™re rusty on Normal distribution calculations).

### 1. There are a few SDs above. Explain in words in context what each of these SDs represent

1. 1.5

2. 0.5

3. 0.26

4. Also, what does 1.5 / sqrt(25) represent?

### 2. Compute and interpret a 67% central prior credible interval for theta.

### 3. Compute and interpret a 98% central prior credible interval for theta.

### 4. Compute and interpret the prior probability that theta is less than 7.5.

### 5. Compute and interpret a 67% central posterior credible interval for theta.

### 6. Compute and interpret a 98% central posterior credible interval for theta.

### 7. Compute and interpret the posterior probability that theta is less than 7.5.
